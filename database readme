Certainly! Let's outline the basic details for each user type in the Result Management System, including super admin, school/university staff, students, and logs. We'll focus on the MySQL database schema, highlighting the key tables and their relationships.

### MySQL Database Schema:

#### 1. Super Admin:

- **Table: `super_admin`**
  - Columns:
    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `username`
    - `password` (Hashed and Salted for security)
    - `email`
    - `created_at`
    - `updated_at`

#### 2. School/University Staff:

- **Table: `school_staff`**
  - Columns:
    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `school_id` (Foreign Key referencing `schools` table)
    - `username`
    - `password` (Hashed and Salted for security)
    - `email`
    - `role` (Admin, Teacher, etc.)
    - `created_at`
    - `updated_at`

- **Table: `schools`**
  - Columns:
    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `name`
    - `location`
    - `created_at`
    - `updated_at`

#### 3. Students:

- **Table: `students`**
  - Columns:
    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `school_id` (Foreign Key referencing `schools` table)
    - `registration_number`
    - `name`
    - `class`
    - `section`
    - `roll_number`
    - `username`
    - `password` (Hashed and Salted for security)
    - `email`
    - `created_at`
    - `updated_at`

#### 4. Logs:

- **Table: `activity_logs`**
  - Columns:
    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing either `super_admin`, `school_staff`, or `students` depending on the user initiating the activity)
    - `activity_type` (Login, Logout, Result Generation, etc.)
    - `timestamp`
    - `details` (Additional details about the activity)

### User Roles and Permissions:

- **Super Admin:**
  - Full access to all functionalities.
  
- **School/University Staff:**
  - Access to result generation, student management, and school information.
  
- **Students:**
  - Access to view their own results and personal information.
  
### Security Measures:

- Passwords should be hashed and salted using industry-standard algorithms.
  
- Use prepared statements or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### Relationships:

- Super admin, school staff, and students are associated with schools through foreign keys, establishing relationships between users and educational institutions.

This is a simplified outline to get you started. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to add more tables or columns. Additionally, you can incorporate more advanced features like access control lists (ACLs) for fine-grained permissions. Remember to adapt the schema to the specific needs and complexities of your Result Management System.
